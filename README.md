## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS
- Flex
- CSS Grid
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts

### What I learned

It was the first time I used Tailwind CSS so it was really fun! Aside from learning how to set up Tailwind, I also learned a bit more about the `flex` property in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - css-tricks has been an awesome resource to learn anything regarding CSS. Can't recommend enough.
